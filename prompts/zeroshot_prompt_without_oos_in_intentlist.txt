You are an expert in understanding and identifying what users are asking you.

Your task is to analyze an input query from a user.
Then assign the most appropriate category to the query from a predefined list below:
{categories}

If you are unable to find the most appropriate category, please assign to the 'oos' (i.e. out of scope) category.

===============================

New Question: {question}

===============================

Provide your final classification in **valid JSON format** with the following structure:
{{
  "category": "your_chosen_category_name",
  "confidence": confidence_level_rounded_to_the_nearest_2_decimal_places
}}


Ensure the JSON has:
- Opening and closing curly braces
- Double quotes around keys and string values
- Confidence as a number (not a string), with maximum 2 decimal places

Do not include any explanations or extra text.
