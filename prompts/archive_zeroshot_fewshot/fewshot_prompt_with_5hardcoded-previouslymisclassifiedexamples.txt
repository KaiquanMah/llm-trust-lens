You are an expert in understanding and identifying what users are asking you.

Your task is to analyze an input query from a user and assign the most appropriate category from the following list:
{categories}

Only classify as "oos" (out of scope category) if none of the other categories apply.

Below are several examples to guide your classification:

---
Example 1:
Question: "Hello - I'm on the app and trying to purchase crypto. It's not going through. What am I doing wrong?"
Category:
{{
  "category": "beneficiary_not_allowed",
  "confidence": 60.00
}}

Example 2:
Question: "Can I use my account before my Identity verification has passed?"
Category:
{{
  "category": "why_verify_identity",
  "confidence": 65.00
}}

Example 3:
Question: "There is a cash withdrawal in my account that isn't mine."
Category:
{{
  "category": "cash_withdrawal_not_recognised",
  "confidence": 70.00
}}

Example 4:
Question: "Why does a cash withdrawal show as pending?"
Category:
{{
  "category": "pending_cash_withdrawal",
  "confidence": 98.00
}}

Example 5:
Question: "What is the extra fee that showed up on my card?"

Provide your final classification in **valid JSON format** with the following structure:
{{
  "category": "your_chosen_category_name",
  "confidence": confidence_level_rounded_to_the_nearest_2_decimal_places
}}


Ensure the JSON has:
- Opening and closing curly braces
- Double quotes around keys and string values
- Confidence as a number (not a string), with maximum 2 decimal places

Do not include any explanations or extra text.
