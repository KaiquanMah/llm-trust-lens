# Defines a Few-shot experiment using an Ollama model on the clinc150oos dataset.

# 1. DATASET CONFIGURATION
dataset_config: "config/dataset/clinc150oos.yaml"
# The starting row index from the dataset to process (0-based)
start_index: 0
# process up to and including the end_index row of the dataset
# The ending row index. Use 'null' to process to the end of the dataset
# 'null' is the YAML equivalent of Python's None
# eg: 9, 9999, 11850 or null
end_index: 8 # 10 # null
# Force dataset to contain an 'oos' class
# using the last class value (sorted alphabetically), 
# if 'oos' class does not exist in the original dataset
force_oos: true
# list of indexes to use as 'oos' class
# please analyse the classes to gather this list of 'oos' indexes, 
# then use within the team across various open intent classification approaches 
# -> for reproducible and comparable results
list_oos_idx: [2, 7, 12, 20, 27, 28, 35, 38, 41, 49, 51, 56, 58, 59, 61, 64, 66, 68, 69, 70, 71, 74, 79, 87, 89, 90, 91, 93, 100, 103, 108, 109, 111, 133, 137, 143]

# 2. MODEL CONFIGURATION
model_provider: "ollama"
model_name: "llama3.2:3b" # The model name registered in your Ollama instance
ollama_host: "http://localhost:11434"

# 3. TECHNIQUE CONFIGURATION
technique: "fewshot"
prompt_template_path: "prompts/fewshot_prompt.txt"
few_shot:
  examples_path: "prompts/few_shot_examples/oos/oos_25perc_oos.txt"

# 4. RUN CONTROL & PROCESSING
# Parameters that control the behavior and scope of this specific experiment
run_control:
  # How often to log progress updates (e.g., every N examples)
  log_every_n_examples: 2 # 10


# 5. DATA SUBSET TO TEST IMPACT OF OOS THRESHOLD ON METRICS
threshold:
  # If true, commence threshold test 
  # to process questions to check non-oos classes vs oos (out-of-scope) class
  filter_oos_qns_only: false
  # where we filter the dataframe later to keep only the 1st non-oos class as examples to input to LLM
  first_class_banking: 'activate_my_card' # following idx2label
  first_class_stackoverflow: 'wordpress' # following idx2label
  first_class_oos: 'oos'
  # The number of questions to filter and keep if the 'filter_oos_qns_only' flag is true
  n_oos_qns: 100

# 6. OUTPUT CONFIGURATION
