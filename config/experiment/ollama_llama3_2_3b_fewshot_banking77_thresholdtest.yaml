# Defines a Few-shot experiment using an Ollama model on the Banking77 dataset.

# 1. DATASET CONFIGURATION
dataset_config: "config/dataset/banking77.yaml"
# The starting row index from the dataset to process (0-based)
start_index: 0
# process up to and including the end_index row of the dataset
# The ending row index. Use 'null' to process to the end of the dataset
# 'null' is the YAML equivalent of Python's None
# eg: 9, 9999, 11850 or null
end_index: null  # keep as 'null' to process all filtered questions when doing threshold test
# Force dataset to contain an 'oos' class
# using the last class value (sorted alphabetically), 
# if 'oos' class does not exist in the original dataset
force_oos: true
# list of indexes to use as 'oos' class
# please analyse the classes to gather this list of 'oos' indexes, 
# then use within the team across various open intent classification approaches 
# -> for reproducible and comparable results
