# Defines a Few-shot experiment using Google Gemini API model on the Banking77 dataset.

# 1. DATASET CONFIGURATION
dataset_config: "config/dataset/banking77.yaml"
# The starting row index from the dataset to process (0-based)
start_index: 0
# process up to and excluding the end_index row of the dataset
# The ending row index. Use 'null' to process to the end of the dataset
# 'null' is the YAML equivalent of Python's None
# eg: 10, 10000, 11850 or null
end_index: 8 # 10 # null
# Force dataset to contain an 'oos' class
# using the last class value (sorted alphabetically), 
# if 'oos' class does not exist in the original dataset
force_oos: true
# list of indexes to use as 'oos' class
# please analyse the classes to gather this list of 'oos' indexes, 
# then use within the team across various open intent classification approaches 
# -> for reproducible and comparable results
list_oos_idx: [2, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 25, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 52, 53, 54, 57, 73, 76]

# 2. MODEL CONFIGURATION
model_provider: "google"  # API-based model provider
model_name: "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20"
# API-specific configuration
api_config:
  # Base URL for Gemini API endpoint - keep as empty string for default
  # Otherwise if you have a custom endpoint, specify it here - for more details see: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/vertex#overview
  base_url: ""
  # Name of environment variable that contains the API key
  # Ensure this environment variable is set before running
  api_key_env: "GOOGLE_API_KEY"
  # Retry configuration for handling API rate limits and temporary failures
  retry:
    # Maximum number of retry attempts for failed API calls
    max_attempts: 3
    # Wait time in seconds between retry attempts
    wait_seconds: 30
  # Model inference parameters
  temperature: 0  # Set to 0 for most deterministic outputs
  seed: 38  # Fixed seed for reproducibility

# 3. TECHNIQUE CONFIGURATION
technique: "fewshot"
prompt_template_path: "prompts/fewshot_prompt.txt"
few_shot:
  examples_path: "prompts/few_shot_examples/banking77/banking_25perc_oos.txt"

# 4. RUN CONTROL & PROCESSING
# Parameters that control the behavior and scope of this specific experiment
run_control:
  # How often to log progress updates (e.g., every N examples)
  log_every_n_examples: 2 # 10

# 5. DATA SUBSET TO TEST IMPACT OF OOS THRESHOLD ON METRICS
threshold:
  # If true, commence threshold test 
  # to process questions to check non-oos classes vs oos (out-of-scope) class
  filter_oos_qns_only: false
  # where we filter the dataframe later to keep only the 1st non-oos class as examples to input to LLM
  first_class_banking: 'activate_my_card' # following idx2label
  first_class_stackoverflow: 'wordpress' # following idx2label
  first_class_oos: 'oos'
  # The number of questions to filter and keep if the 'filter_oos_qns_only' flag is true
  n_oos_qns: 100

# 6. OUTPUT CONFIGURATION
output_dir: "results/banking77_fewshot_google_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20"
